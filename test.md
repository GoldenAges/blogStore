#sample 1
Fix bug where user can't signup.

[Bug #2873942]

Users were unable to register if they hadn't visited the plans
and pricing page because we expected that tracking
information to exist for the logs we create after a user
signs up.  I fixed this by adding a check to the logger
to ensure that if that information was not available
we weren't trying to write it.

#sample 2
Redirect user to the requested page after login

https://trello.com/path/to/relevant/card

Users were being redirected to the home page after login, which is less
useful than redirecting to the page they had originally requested before
being redirected to the login form.

* Store requested path in a session variable
* Redirect to the stored location after successfully logging in the user
